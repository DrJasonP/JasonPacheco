<h3>Preamble</h3>
<p style=margin-top:2%;>My name is Jason Pacheco, and im writing this blog with no goal other than to entertain myself, and track my thoughts at certain times. I also made it to share my opinions and thoughts. I probably wont post consistently and the types of content posted wont be consistent either. This website is called Jason Pache.co; in other words, its all about me. Just kidding, but Im the only person with access to this file, so I will be the only one posting. I believe that 
<br>
<br>
if God so loved us, then we also ought to love one another. No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God resides in us, and his love is perfected in us. By this we know that we reside in God and he in us: in that he has given us of his Spirit. And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world. - 1 John 4:28-37
