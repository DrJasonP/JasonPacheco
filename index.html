<h3>Preamble</h3>
<p style=margin-top:2%;>My name is Jason Pacheco, and im writing this blog with no goal other than to entertain myself, and track my thoughts at certain times. I also made it to share my opinions and thoughts. I probably wont post consistently and the types of content posted wont be consistent either. This website is called Jason Pache.co; in other words, its all about me. Just kidding, but Im the only person with access to this file, so I will be the only one posting. I believe that

if God so loved us, then we also ought to love one another. No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God resides in us, and his love is perfected in us. By this we know that we reside in God and he in us: in that he has given us of his Spirit. And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world. - 1 John 4:28-37

<strong>A fly on the wall-&nbsp</strong>It is funny how everybody wants to make a name for themselves. They want to be put on a pedestool so that other people will care about them more. As if anybody can make another human care about someone else more than themselves. Pride just makes other people more prideful. If someone tries to show-off their favorable circumstances, it only causes others to be absorbed in obtaining the same image. In a way, pride drives productivity. It creates a world where everybody is trying to one-up each other. This obviously fuels innovation and hard work which allows mankind to progress. But what exactly are we progressing towards? Does efficiency = happiness? Does technology = joy? I wonder how happy humans would be with only the bare minimum, but also without any pride. If everyone took a step back and thought about the world with eternity in mind, they would see that nothing matters. Family, friends, finances, and health are irrelevant. All the money saved in a lifetime is of no more value than a fly on a wall. Ecclesiastes 1:2 - Everything is meaningless
