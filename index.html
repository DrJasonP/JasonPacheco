<h3>Preamble</h3>
<p style=margin-top:2%;>My name is Jason Pacheco, and im writing this blog with no goal other than to entertain myself, and track my thoughts at certain times. I also made it to share my opinions and thoughts. I probably wont post consistently and the types of content posted wont be consistent either. This website is called Jason Pache.co; in other words, its all about me. Just kidding, but Im the only person with access to this file, so I will be the only one posting. I believe that 
<br>
<br>
if God so loved us, then we also ought to love one another. No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God resides in us, and his love is perfected in us. By this we know that we reside in God and he in us: in that he has given us of his Spirit. And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son to be the Savior of the world. - 1 John 4:28-37

<strong>A fly on the wall-&nbsp</strong>It is funny how everybody wants to make a name for themselves. They want to be put on a pedestool so that other people will care about them more. As if anybody can make another human care about someone else more than themselves. Pride just makes other people more prideful. If someone tries to show-off their favorable circumstances, it only causes others to be absorbed in obtaining the same image. In a way, pride drives productivity. It creates a world where everybody is trying to one-up each other. This obviously fuels innovation and hard work which allows mankind to progress. But what exactly are we progressing towards? Does efficiency = happiness? Does technology = joy? I wonder how happy humans would be with only the bare minimum, but also without any pride. If everyone took a step back and thought about the world with eternity in mind, they would see that nothing matters. Family, friends, finances, and health are irrelevant. All the money saved in a lifetime is of no more value than a fly on a wall. Ecclesiastes 1:2 - Everything is meaningless

<strong>What is college-&nbsp</strong>College might be the worst invention ever. Why do I need to take general ed courses after spending four years taking them in high school? Why do I need to take two semesters of chemistry for a software engineering major? Why does it cost so much? The teachers dont actually teach the class and its like that at every school. Why would you become a teacher? Most teachers would say it is because they have a <em>passion for teaching</em>. They must only have that passion every other day. When im older, I'm gonna make my own school where the teachers actually want to be there. Because if the teachers want to be there, the students want to be there. And if the teachers want to teach, the students want to learn.

<strong>Programming-&nbsp</strong>Programming, it turns out, is hard. It is difficult to learn, and difficult to execute. But being able to develop software has become a type of superpower in todays world. One day, I hope I can create anything my mind can think of. Only a small group of people are able to accomplish this task because it involves so much knowledge and experience. I am majoring in software development, and dont want to work at a big company, or any company for that matter. Let me re-phrase that; I wouldnt want to work at a company that I didnt own. I cant imagine writing code for somebody elses project. How could I use my brain to come up with new ideas for something that is not even mine? I love the idea of software because youn can create anything, for free. There are no materials required and nobody can tell you to stop making what you are making. My goal is to master software development so I can work on my own projects and make enough money to drop out of school. For the amount of ideas God gives me, I like my odds.
